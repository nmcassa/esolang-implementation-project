# 11CORTLANG

## diff

I ended up changing some parts of this esolang

There used to be a command for 'anything else' which I scraped and made up for by changing the 1010 command to go backwards lines instead of forwards. 

## Hello, World!

This terminates w/ an error or else it will loop indefinitely
