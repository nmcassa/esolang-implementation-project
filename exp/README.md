# Exp
[Exp](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Exp) is an esolang based on expressions by [PythonshellDebugWindow](https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:PythonshellDebugwindow)

The interpreter for this is very loose but it fits his examples and should work with others. Could be broken easily I guess.

```
python interpret.py hello.exp
```
