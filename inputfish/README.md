# Inputfish

[Inputfish](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Inputfish) is an language by [ChuckEsoteric08](https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:ChuckEsoteric08)

it only has two commands

i = input
ox = output byte x

input can't really do anything, unless we add an escape character for i and have oi output the input

so it's kinda just a one command lang
